1. Question 1
What is the size of the array needed to store integer keys with up to 1212 digits using direct addressing?

ans:10^12

2. Question 2
What is the maximum possible chain length for a hash function h(x)=xmod1000 used with a hash table of size 10001000 for a universe of all integers with at most 1212 digits?

ans: 10^9

3. Question 3
You want to hash integers from 00 up to 10000001000000. What can be a good choice of pp for the universal family?

ans:1000003

4. Question 4
How can one build a universal family of hash functions for integers between -1000000-1000000 (minus one million) and 10000001000000 (one million)?

Ans: First, add 10000001000000 to each integer and get the range of integers between 00 and 20000002000000. Then use the universal family for integers with p = 2000003p=2000003.
